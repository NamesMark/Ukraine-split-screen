# Ukraine before and after russia

I wanted to have a convenient comparison for a long time. Now the grim maps are here.

# Date range

It's estimated that the Google map (above) is ~ April 1st 2022 (middle of Mariupol siege), Bing map (below) sometime pre-war.

# Known problems

Sometimes the Bing map won't load on the first page load, so please try refreshing the page.

# Add new places

Currently adding new places is manual. Send interesting or useful places to me on Twitter, and I'll add them. The preferred format is like this:
```
<option value="47.09608780316091,37.548594984979225,15">Drama Theater</option>
```
, where 47.09608780316091,37.548594984979225 are coordinates as seen in any Google Maps URL, and '15' is an optional parameter for your preferred zoom level (as close as possible, but all important things are visible)

# Risks

This could get broken at any time with new updates of Satellite info of either Google or Bing. Make screenshots while you can.
